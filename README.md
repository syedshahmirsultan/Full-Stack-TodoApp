# üìù FULL-STACK TODO App
This project is a Full-Stack Todo App that performs CRUD operations. It consists of two parts: the frontend, where the UI is connected with the APIs, and the backend, where the APIs for CRUD operations are created.

## üì¶ FRONTEND BUILT WITH
‚Ä¢ [Next.js 14.2](https://nextjs.org/docs)  
‚Ä¢ [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  
‚Ä¢ [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)  
‚Ä¢ [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)  

For the frontend, I use Next.js as a TypeScript framework and TypeScript as the programming language. DaisyUI components are used to save time and make the website more functional, 
and React-Icons are used to enhance the visual appeal of the website.

## üì¶ BACKEND BUILT WITH
‚Ä¢ [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)  
‚Ä¢ [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)  
‚Ä¢ [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
‚Ä¢ [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)  
‚Ä¢ [SqlModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/)  
‚Ä¢ [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/)  
‚Ä¢ [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/)  
‚Ä¢ [Neon Serverless PostgreSQL Database](https://neon.tech/)  

For the backend, I use Poetry as the package manager and FastAPI as the framework, with Python as the programming language. Uvicorn is used to run the FastAPI server,
and the SqlModel library is used to interact with the Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database. Psycopg serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to facilitate communication
between FastAPI and the Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database. Additionally, I use Pytest to ensure that my CRUD APIs are working correctly.
